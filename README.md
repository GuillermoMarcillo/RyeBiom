A set of functions to simulate cover crop growth under non-stress conditions

Point-based simulations of plant growth demand large amounts of quality inputs, and 
are usually coded as a sequence of multiple processes involving several parameters.
A simple model based on resource harvest and transformation would help to produce
point-based simulations of cereal rye when adapted as a winter cover crop in Iowa.
The semi-mechanistic model assumes free availability of crop resources from cover
seeding to cover crop termination.
